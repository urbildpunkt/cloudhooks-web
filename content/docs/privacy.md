# Privacy Policy

## INFORMAL SUMMARY
We hold onto your store's URL, email, and Shopify OAuth access token so that we can act on your behalf when running your code in response to a web hook.

We temporarily hold onto logs of what actions your code takes so that we can provide you with a debugging UI. All log data is deleted after 30 days.

Our API is accessed over HTTPS and our database resides in the same AWS region as our application server, which means traffic going between is not publicly accessible.



## MORE FORMAL DETAILS
Your privacy is important to us. It is Brendan Keane Barr's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, https://serverless-extensions.herokuapp.com (Cloudhooks), and other sites we own and operate.

We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we're collecting it and how it will be used.

We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, weâ€™ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

We don't share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.

Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.

Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.

If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.

Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you, or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above. Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.

For more information about our privacy practices, if you have questions, or if you would like to make a complaint, please contact us by e-mail at brendan@cloudhooks.dev

This policy is effective as of 11 May 2020.
